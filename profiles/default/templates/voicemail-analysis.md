<voicemail_transcript>
{{voicemail_transcript}}
</voicemail_transcript>

This message was left specifically for the office staff of an apartment community, so please analyze the content with that context in mind.

Read the voicemail message carefully and identify the key sentiments that are expressed by the caller. Focus on capturing the sentiments in single words that get to the heart of the emotions conveyed, as they relate to living in or interacting with the apartment community. 

Also identify the main topics that the caller mentions in their message. Again, try to capture the essence of these topics in single words, and only extract topics that are relevant given the apartment community context.

The values for "sentiments" and "topics" should each be a list containing 1-5 single-word strings. Use the minimum number of sentiments and topics needed to capture the core meaning of the message.
