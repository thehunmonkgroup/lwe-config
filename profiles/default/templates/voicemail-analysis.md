# TASK

Here is the transcript of a voicemail message left for the office staff of an apartment community:

<voicemail_transcript id="{{ identifier }}">
{{transcription}}
</voicemail_transcript>

Analyze the content of this voicemail message, keeping the apartment community context in mind. This context should guide your understanding and interpretation of the caller's message.

Read the voicemail message carefully and identify the key sentiments expressed by the caller. Capture these sentiments in single words that reflect the tone and emotions conveyed, as they relate to living in or interacting with an apartment community.

Identify the main categories mentioned by the caller in their message. Capture the essence of these categories in concise, single-word terms, focusing on categories relevant to the apartment community context.

Determine the urgency level (high, medium, low, or unknown), caller type (resident, prospect, staff, vendor, government, legal, sales, media, external, other, or unknown), and primary language (english, spanish, other, or unknown).

For sentiments and categories, provide your output as a comma-separated list of single-word strings. Use the minimum number of words needed to capture the core meaning of the message and the relevant data points.

For urgency, caller type, and language, provide one and only one word from the predetermined list for each kind of data.

## RULES FOR EXTRACTED SENTIMENTS

Each extracted sentiment should:
- Accurately reflect the caller's emotions, attitudes, or tone conveyed in the voicemail
- Be a single word that captures a specific aspect of the caller's sentiment
- Be expressed as a past participle or adjective (e.g., 'frustrated' instead of 'frustration')
- Be relevant to the content and context of the voicemail message

Reference list of sentiments:

- polite
- frustrated
- concerned
- interested
- urgent
- appreciative
- disappointed
- confused
- angry
- satisfied
- helpful
- anxious
- apologetic
- reassuring
- sympathetic
- professional
- friendly
- calm
- detached
- neutral
- unknown

If an extracted sentiment is semantically similar to one from the reference list, use the term from the reference list for consistency. You may use a sentiment that is not in the reference list, but only if the sentiment can be clearly determined, is not similar to any sentiments in the reference list, and can be expressed in a single word.

If no clear sentiment can be determined, use `unknown`.

### Example output formats:
<sentiments>polite</sentiments>
<sentiments>frustrated</sentiments>
<sentiments>concerned, confused</sentiments>
<sentiments>appreciative, satisfied</sentiments>
<sentiments>urgent, anxious, apologetic</sentiments>
<sentiments>friendly, helpful</sentiments>
<sentiments>disappointed, angry</sentiments>
<sentiments>calm, professional</sentiments>
<sentiments>interested, friendly, polite</sentiments>
<sentiments>reassuring, sympathetic</sentiments>
<sentiments>unknown</sentiments>

When extracting sentiments, consider the following:
- Focus on the most prominent and clearly expressed sentiments in the voicemail
- Use the predefined list of sentiments as a guide, but allow for the inclusion of other relevant sentiments when necessary
- Ensure that the extracted sentiments are consistent with the content and tone of the specific voicemail message
- Aim to capture a range of sentiments that accurately represent the caller's emotions and attitudes throughout the voicemail

## RULES FOR EXTRACTED CATEGORIES

Choose one broad category from the following list that best represents the main focus or purpose of the voicemail message:

- leasing
- maintenance
- billing
- resident
- amenity
- safety
- parking
- communication
- inquiry
- other

Choose up to two additional subcategories that provide the most essential and relevant details about the content of the voicemail. Each subcategory should be a single word that is clearly related to the broad category and the voicemail message. Use the predefined subcategories whenever possible to maintain consistency.

Subcategories:
- leasing: application, tour, availability, pricing, approval, renewal, termination, move-in
- maintenance: repair, request, plumbing, electric, appliance, hvac, pest, emergency
- billing: rent, payment, fee, deposit, utility, late, dispute, error
- resident: mail, package, noise, complaint, guest, pet, parking, violation
- amenity: fitness, pool, clubhouse, internet, reservation, access
- safety: security, access, gate, lighting, incident, emergency
- parking: violation, towing, assigned, reserved, permit, guest
- communication: callback, inquiry, follow-up, contact, message, status, update
- inquiry: hours, location, service, policy, feedback, pricing, availability, amenity

Use the `other` category sparingly and only when the voicemail content does not fit into any of the broad categories or subcategories. When using the `other` category, provide a single-word description of the main topic that is general enough to potentially apply to multiple voicemails. Avoid creating highly specific or unique subcategories for the `other` category, as this can lead to a long tail of rarely used subcategories. If the `other` category is used, the subcategory should still be relevant to the apartment community context and should not overlap with any existing broad categories or subcategories. If the voicemail content is too specific or unique to be adequately described by a general subcategory under `other`, consider using the `unknown` category instead.

Use the `unknown` category only when the voicemail is unclear, incomplete, or lacks sufficient information to determine a category or subcategory.

Before creating a new subcategory, carefully consider whether the voicemail content can be adequately described by an existing broad category or subcategory. If a new subcategory is necessary, think about whether it is likely to apply to multiple voicemails or if it is too specific to the current voicemail. Prioritize using existing subcategories whenever possible, even if they don't perfectly match the voicemail content, as long as they capture the main topic or issue. Remember that the goal is to maintain a focused and consistent set of categories and subcategories across all voicemails, rather than creating unique subcategories for each individual voicemail.

If multiple broad categories apply, choose the one that best represents the main focus or purpose of the message.

<categories>unknown</categories>
<categories>maintenance, appliance, repair</categories>
<categories>leasing, tour, pricing</categories>
<categories>safety, emergency</categories>

## RULES FOR EXTRACTED URGENCY LEVEL

Determine the urgency level based on the content and tone of the message:

- high: The message conveys immediacy, emergency, or critical importance, such as issues related to safety, security, or essential services that require prompt attention.
- medium: The message indicates a need for timely response or action, but does not rise to the level of an emergency, such as maintenance requests or time-sensitive inquiries that impact the resident's comfort or convenience.
- low: The message is informational, routine, or does not require immediate action, such as general inquiries, feedback, or non-urgent requests.
- unknown: The urgency level cannot be clearly determined from the content of the message.

Consider the following factors when assessing urgency:
- Timeframe keywords (e.g., "immediately," "urgent," "as soon as possible")
- Safety and security concerns
- Issues with essential services (electricity, water, heating, air conditioning)
- Caller's tone and level of distress

If no clear urgency can be determined, use `unknown`.

### Example output format:

<urgency>high</urgency>
<urgency>medium</urgency>
<urgency>low</urgency>
<urgency>unknown</urgency>

## RULES FOR EXTRACTED CALLER TYPE

Identify a single caller type based on the content of the message, which must be one of the following types:

- resident: Current or former resident of the property
- prospect: Prospective resident interested in living at the property
- staff: Property owner, manager, or employee
- vendor: Vendor, contractor, delivery person, or utility company representative
- government: Government agency representative
- legal: Legal representative, attorney, or insurance company representative
- sales: Real estate agent or potential buyer
- media: Media or press representative
- external: Family member, friend, guarantor, guest of a resident, neighboring property resident or owner, local business owner, community organization representative
- other: Caller type does not fit into any of the above categories
- unknown: Caller type cannot be clearly determined

For the purpose of extracting the caller type, the caller is the person leaving the message.

### Example output format:

<caller_type>resident</caller_type>
<caller_type>prospect</caller_type>
<caller_type>staff</caller_type>
<caller_type>vendor</caller_type>
<caller_type>government</caller_type>
<caller_type>legal</caller_type>
<caller_type>sales</caller_type>
<caller_type>media</caller_type>
<caller_type>external</caller_type>
<caller_type>other</caller_type>
<caller_type>unknown</caller_type>

## RULES FOR EXTRACTED LANGUAGE

Identify the primary language used in the transcription:

- english: The voicemail transcription is primarily in English
- spanish: The voicemail transcription is primarily in Spanish
- other: The voicemail transcription is primarily in a language other than English or Spanish

If no clear language can be determined, use `unknown`.

### Example output format:

<language>english</language>
<language>spanish</language>
<language>other</language>
