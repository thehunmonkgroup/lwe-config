# TASK

Here is the transcript of a voicemail message that was left specifically for the office staff of an apartment community:

<voicemail_transcript id="{{ identifier }}">
{{transcription}}
</voicemail_transcript>

As you analyze the content of this voicemail message, it is crucial to keep the apartment community context at the forefront of your mind. This context should serve as the foundation for your understanding and interpretation of the caller's message.

Read the voicemail message carefully and identify the key sentiments expressed by the caller. Focus on capturing these sentiments in single words that get to the heart of the tone and emotions conveyed, as they relate to living in or interacting with an apartment community.

In addition to sentiments, identify the main categories mentioned by the caller in their message. Aim to capture the essence of these categories in concise, single-word terms, ensuring that you only extract categories that are relevant to the apartment community context.

As you analyze the voicemail transcription, also determine the urgency level of the message (high, medium, low, or unknown), the caller type (resident, prospect, staff, vendor, government, legal, sales, media, external, or other), and the primary language used in the transcription (english, spanish, or other). Refer to the previously provided rules and categories for guidance on accurately identifying these additional data points.

For the `sentiments` and `categories` data points provide your output as a comma-separated list of single-word strings. Use the minimum number of words needed to capture the core meaning of the message and the relevant data points.

For the `urgency`, `caller_type`, and `language` data points, provide your output as a single-word string from the restricted list of options provided for each type of data point.

While the voicemail transcription may be in either English or Spanish, your analysis and output should always be provided in English to maintain consistency and clarity for the intended audience.

## RULES FOR EXTRACTED SENTIMENTS:

Each extracted sentiment should:

* ALWAYS indicate a human tone or emotion
* ALWAYS be a single word
* ALWAYS be expressed as a past participle/adjective (e.g., 'frustrated' instead of 'frustration')

Please use the following reference list of sentiments whenever possible:

polite, frustrated, concerned, interested, urgent, appreciative, disappointed, confused, angry, satisfied, helpful, anxious, apologetic, reassuring, sympathetic, professional, friendly, calm, detached, neutral

If a sentiment is not adequately captured by any of the sentiments in the reference list, you may use a different sentiment that accurately reflects the tone or emotion expressed in the voicemail. However, please only do so if absolutely necessary and ensure that the sentiment is clear, concise, and relevant to the apartment community context.

If no clear sentiment can be determined from the message, use `unknown` as the sentiment.

Example output format:
<sentiments>polite, concerned</sentiments>

## RULES FOR EXTRACTED CATEGORIES

For each voicemail message, you must choose one broad category from the following list:

 * leasing
 * maintenance
 * billing
 * resident
 * amenity
 * safety
 * parking
 * communication
 * other

After selecting the broad category, you may choose up to four additional subcategories that provide more specific details about the content of the voicemail. These subcategories should be single words that are relevant to the broad category and the voicemail message.

Examples of subcategories for each broad category:

 * leasing: application, tour, approval, moving, renewal, termination
 * maintenance: repair, plumbing, electric, appliance, hvac, pest, landscape, clean
 * billing: rent, fee, deposit, utility, statement, balance, refund
 * resident: package, mail, deliveries, laundry, trash, guest, pet, parking, noise
 * amenity: fitness, pool, clubhouse, lounge, internet, cable
 * safety: security, access, key, gate, fire, emergency, incident
 * parking: assigned, reserved, guest, violation, towing, vehicle
 * communication: callback, message, contact, inquiry, followup, status, update
 * other: [use relevant single-word subcategories as needed]

Each extracted category should:

 * ALWAYS be words that could reasonably relate to a subject that would be left in a voicemail message to the office of an apartment community
 * ALWAYS be a single word
 * ALWAYS be expressed as an adjective or noun that describes a broad category, not a specific action (e.g.,'moving' instead of 'move_in' or 'move_out')

When selecting subcategories, prioritize clarity, relevance, and consistency. Avoid overly specific or irrelevant topics.

If a voicemail message does not require any additional subcategories beyond the broad category, you may choose fewer than four subcategories or none at all.

If multiple broad categories are applicable to a voicemail message, prioritize the one category that best represents the main focus or purpose of the message. This will ensure that the most important or relevant category is always captured in your analysis.

If no clear category or subcategories can be determined from the message, use `unknown` as the sole category.

Example output format:
<categories>leasing, application, fee</categories>

## RULES FOR EXTRACTED URGENCY LEVEL

For each voicemail message, determine the urgency level based on the content and tone of the message. The urgency level should be classified as one and only one of the following:

 * high: The message conveys a sense of immediacy, emergency, or critical importance. This may include issues related to safety, security, or essential services that require prompt attention.
 * medium: The message indicates a need for timely response or action, but does not rise to the level of an emergency. This may include maintenance requests, time-sensitive inquiries, or issues that impact the resident's comfort or convenience.
 * low: The message is informational, routine, or does not require immediate action. This may include general inquiries, feedback, or non-urgent requests.
 * unknown: The urgency level cannot be clearly determined from the content of the message.

When assessing the urgency level, consider the following factors:

* Explicit statements of urgency or time-sensitivity
* Potential impact on resident safety, security, or essential services
* Mention of deadlines or specific timeframes
* Tone and language used by the caller

Example output format:
<urgency>medium</urgency>

## RULES FOR EXTRACTED CALLER TYPE

For each voicemail message, identify one and only one type for the caller based on the content of the message and the following types:

 * resident: The caller is a current or former resident of the property.
 * prospect: The caller is a prospective resident interested in living at the property.
 * staff: The caller is a property owner, manager, or employee.
 * vendor: The caller is a vendor, contractor, delivery person, or utility company representative.
 * government: The caller is a government agency representative.
 * legal: The caller is a legal representative, attorney, or insurance company representative.
 * sales: The caller is a real estate agent or potential buyer.
 * media: The caller is a media or press representative.
 * external: The caller is a family member, friend, guarantor of a resident, neighboring property resident or owner, local business owner, or community organization representative.
 * other: The caller type does not fit into any of the above categories or cannot be clearly determined from the content of the message.

When determining the caller type, consider the following factors:

 * Explicit statements by the caller about their identity or relationship to the property
 * Context clues within the message that suggest the caller's role or association with the property
 * The nature of the inquiry or request made by the caller

If multiple types could potentially apply to a caller, choose only one type, the most specific or relevant type based on the content of the message.

Example output format:
<caller_type>vendor</caller_type>

## RULES FOR EXTRACTED LANGUAGE:

For each voicemail message, identify the primary language used in the transcription. The language should be classified as one of the following:

 * english: The voicemail transcription is primarily in English.
 * spanish: The voicemail transcription is primarily in Spanish.
 * other: The voicemail transcription is primarily in a language other than English or Spanish, or the language cannot be clearly determined.

When determining the language, consider the following factors:

 * The presence of language-specific words, phrases, or grammar structures
 * The overall coherence and comprehensibility of the transcription in a particular language
 * Any explicit mention of the language by the caller or in the transcription metadata

If the voicemail transcription contains a mix of languages, choose one language, the language that is most prevalent or dominant throughout the message.

Example output format:
<language>english</language>
