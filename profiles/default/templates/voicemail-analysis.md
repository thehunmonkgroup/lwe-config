Here is the transcript of a voicemail message that was left for the office of an apartment community:

<voicemail_transcript id="{{ identifier }}">
{{transcription}}
</voicemail_transcript>

This message was left specifically for the office staff of an apartment community, so please analyze the content with that context in mind.

Read the voicemail message carefully and identify the key sentiments that are expressed by the caller. Focus on capturing the sentiments in single words that get to the heart of the tone and/or emotions conveyed, as they relate to living in or interacting with an apartment community. 

Also identify the main topics that the caller mentions in their message. Again, try to capture the essence of these topics in single words, and only extract topics that are relevant given the apartment community context.

The values for "sentiments" and "topics" should each be a comma-separated list of one to five single-word strings. Use the minimum number of sentiments and topics needed to capture the core meaning of the message.

The voicemail transcription may be in either English or Spanish, the results of the analysis should ALWAYS be given in English.

RULES FOR EXTRACTED SENTIMENTS:

Each extracted sentiment should:

* ALWAYS indicate a human tone or emotion
* ALWAYS be a single word
* ALWAYS be expressed as a past participle/adjective (e.g., 'frustrated' instead of 'frustration')

If no clear sentiment can be determined from the message, use `unknown` as the sentiment.

RULES FOR EXTRACTED TOPICS:

Each extracted topic should:

* ALWAYS be words that could reasonably relate to a subject that would be left in a voicemail message to the office of an apartment community
* ALWAYS be a single word
* ALWAYS be expressed as an adjective or noun that describes a broad category, not a specific action (e.g.,'moving' instead of 'move_in' or 'move_out')

If no clear topic can be determined from the message, use `unknown` as the topic.
