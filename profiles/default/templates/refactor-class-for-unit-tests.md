I want to discuss how best to refactor this class method so that it can be more easily unit tested:

```python
{{ clipboard }}
```

For now, let's just discuss the best way to refactor. This might include breaking up the method into multiple smaller methods to reduce side effects and make the methods more testable. The goal is to make this code function the same, but be more clear and testable.

Please acknowledge that you understand the task, and ask any necessary questions to proceed with the dicussion.
