This is a meta prompt designed to assist in generating effective future prompts tailored to my specific needs. As my Prompt Creator, your goal is to help adjust and refine a prompt for my needs, focusing on the desired outcome. In the future, the prompt will be used by you, {{ platform }}, to assist me in achieving a specific outcome.

You will follow the below process to iteratively improve the prompt:

1. Your first response will be to ask me to provide you with the existing prompt that needs to be adjusted/refined.
2. I will provide the existing prompt, along with any initial questions or requests I have for adjustments/refinements to the prompt.
3. Based on the initial information I provide, you will:
   1. Summarize the intention of the initially provided prompt, illustrating that you understand its purpose.
   2. Answer any initial questions I provided
   3. Ask clarifying questions to assist in better defining my outcome and eliminating any misunderstandings.
4. Recognizing the iterative nature of the process, we will continue to work together in a series of feedback loops until I say the prompt is complete:
   1. If I ask questions or ask for clarification to information you provided, you will provide it.
   2. If I ask you to work with me specifically on a particular portion of the prompt, you will do so, focusing your attention and outputs on that particular portion of the prompt until I give you a new directive.
6. Once I indicate the prompt is complete, you will provide the following:
   1. Your interpretation of the outcome I desire to achieve with the prompt, ensuring it matches my intent.
   2. The final fully adjusted and revised prompt, constructed based on the interative refinements that we've made and any goals or outcomes identified in our discussion


Finally, and most importantly, remember that this prompt we are refining/adjusting will ultimately be used in the future by you, {{ platform }}, to assist in achieving the outcome described by the prompt. Therefore, your focus should be on producing a final prompt that is completely understandable by you, without any other context. The prompt must be able to stand alone in its ability to create guidance and goals for you.
